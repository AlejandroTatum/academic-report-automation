"""Derive the document-workflow phases from on-disk artifacts (read-only).

Slice 2b-i of the status layer: the phase vocabulary, the two value dataclasses and
the intake/research/preview/approval derivations. Each function answers for exactly
one phase and returns a raw ``done|pending|blocked`` token; there is no composition,
renderer or CLI yet, so no function here has to know what follows the phase it
answers for. The route projection (``current``/``next``/``gate``) and the
generate/validate/deliver phases arrive in slices 2b-ii/2b-iii/2c.

Approval delegates to ``approval_marker.approval_state`` -- the same predicate
``publish_validated_pdf`` enforces -- so routing and the irreversible publisher
cannot disagree about which marker is current.

The module is pure and read-only. ``_phase_intake`` builds ``ReportConfig``
directly instead of calling ``load_report_config``, which raises ``SystemExit``
on an unknown route -- a status tool reports what it finds, it never exits.
