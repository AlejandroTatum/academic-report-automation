"""Derive the academic-report-flow phases from on-disk artifacts (read-only).

Slice 2c-i of the status layer: the phase vocabulary, the two value dataclasses,
the eleven per-phase derivations, and the ``derive``/``main`` composition on top
of them. Each ``_phase_*`` function answers for exactly one phase and returns a raw
``done|pending|blocked`` token; ``derive`` runs them in order, wraps an unexpected
exception as ``blocked``, locks every phase after the first incomplete one to
``pending``, and projects the route (``current``/``next``/``gate``). ``render_human``
and ``render_machine`` project that value: the portable human block and the
``academic.doc-status/v1`` markdown shape. ``main`` renders both on every invocation.

Approval delegates to ``approval_marker.approval_state`` -- the same predicate
``publish_validated_pdf`` enforces -- so routing and the irreversible publisher
cannot disagree about which marker is current. The plan, verify and review
phases delegate to ``rubric_plan.rubric_state``, ``content_check.content_check_state``
and ``final_review_marker.final_review_state`` for the same reason.

The module is pure and read-only. ``_phase_intake`` builds ``ReportConfig``
directly instead of calling ``load_report_config``, which raises ``SystemExit``
on an unknown route -- a status tool reports what it finds, it never exits.
