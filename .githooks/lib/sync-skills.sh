# Shared implementation for the post-merge / post-checkout / post-rewrite hooks.
#
# Purpose: after the repository changes, push the skills to the agent runtimes
# so a pull is enough to update them. The repo stays the source of truth; the
# runtime directories are mirrors.
#
# This runs on every checkout and every pull, so it must be cheap when nothing
# changed. It fingerprints the tracked contents of skills/ and exits immediately
# when that fingerprint matches the last successful sync.
#
# Git ignores the exit code of post-* hooks, so this can never block a pull.
# It still exits 0 explicitly, and reports failures loudly rather than silently.
